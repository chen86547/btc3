1. The purpose of listing coins or tokens on popular platforms:
In order to issue your own token to be listed on a popular platform like CoinMarketCap, the token must be listed on at least one exchange before it can be listed, so there is a way to set up your own cryptocurrency exchange to save on expensive token listing fees.

2. Save new cryptocurrency listing fees and transaction fees:
Listing fees for new cryptocurrencies on exchanges range from 5 million won to 500 million won on well-known exchanges. If you set up and operate a new cryptocurrency exchange, you will not only save on listing fees, but also on future trading fees.

3. Allocation and use of internal use tokens:
In some cases, cryptocurrency exchanges are set up to create and use tokens for internal trading purposes, which can facilitate all accounting administration and avoid the complexities of dealing with blockchain.

4. Potential market entry:
Most countries around the world recognize blockchain as the core technology of the fourth industrial revolution and are investing in it. Therefore, as many countries are loosening their regulations on cryptocurrencies, it is obvious that opening an exchange in a country where cryptocurrency trading is currently relatively inactive is a good business opportunity.
